# OOS-firmware-updater
Extract firmware from an OxygenOS ROM to a custom flashable firmwareupdater.zip  
Built for and tested on Oneplus 5t (dumpling), but could work on other ROMs using the same file architecture.  
Select a zip, check MD5, unzip, check files and updater-script, then cook to sdcard/firmwareupdater.zip
